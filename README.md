# About
I do a lot of stuff these days, so below in _Sections_ you can jump to what you might be here looking for. Thanks for checking in on me! 

I'm a data scientist who has been working in consulting the last few years. This has been going great because I have gotten into (and still get into) all sorts of different fields, topics, projects, etc. Some work out great, and some don't-- but I always learn something from themm. I'm not just talking about data/coding stuff, but also hobbies, DIY projects, adventures, and so much more! All these experiences help me since I pull from all these different sources and get to synthesize across fields. This keeps my ideas fresh, helps me relate to clients, and avoid a stagnant point of view on things. 

I'm also a dad, a friend, home chef/cook, amateur judoka, cartoonist/artist, lego builder, movie nerd, and so much more.
