### Hi I'm Levi!

Welcome to my profile!

I'm a data scientist, but I'm also a student, husband, brother, NBA fan :basketball:, home chef :spaghetti:, and a movie lover :clapper:. 

This is where I get to collaborate with friends and peers, display cool things I made, and practice my skills. I primarily write R code at the moment, but I'm learning a lot of other technologies to be a better _programmer_. I come have a varied back ground, with internships in different industries like manufacturing, security, and IoT devices. Academically, I completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2019, and I'm working on finishing my M.S. in Computer Science currently.
