### Hi I'm Levi!

Welcome to my profile!

I'm a data scientist (currently working in Software Engineering), but I'm also a new father, husband, brother, NBA fan :basketball:, home chef :spaghetti:, and a movie lover :clapper:. 

This is where I get to collaborate with friends and peers, display cool things I made, and practice my skills. I primarily write R code in my spare time at the moment, and Java/Python at work, but I'm learning a lot of other technologies to be a better all around technologist. I come have a varied back ground, with internships in different industries like manufacturing, security, IoT devices, and Defense. Academically, I completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2019, and finished my M.S. in Computer Science (Concentration in Data Science) in 2021.
